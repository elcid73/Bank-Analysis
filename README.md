# Bank and Restaurant Analysis
I added both .py and Jupeter note book for PyBank assignment, just in case... .py file does exactly what it should when I run it.  Jupeter notebook has been giving me random error while reading the .cvs file.  I restarted the kernel and it worked though.

For restaurant analysis, I didn't get the right results, and am very interested in your feedback on this one.
